# SPARKIFY POSTGRES DATABASE ETL PIPELINE
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app.The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.

The main objective of the project is to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project.
## Project Description
The steps during the project is to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

## Project Datasets
Datasets consists of two sets of data. 
### Song Dataset
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by an event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above.

## Dataset Schema
Here we create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

### Fact Table
songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimension Tables
#### users - users in the app
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

#### songs - songs in music database
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
#### artists - artists in music database
artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
#### time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Structure of the Project 
The following files are available in this project. 
#### test.ipynb - displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.
#### create_tables.py - drops and creates your tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.
#### etl.ipynb -  reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
#### etl.py - reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables. You can fill this out based on your work in the ETL notebook.
#### sql_queries.py - contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.

### Project Steps
#### Create Tables
1. Write DROP, CREATE TABLES in sql_queries.py 
#### Build ETL 
2. Here we build ETL pipeline by extracting the data from the datasets and insert the data in to the corresponding tables.
